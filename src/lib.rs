//! # Deferred logging, for instance for `printf()`-debugging (*a.k.a* tracing)
//!
//! This is an implementation of the `log::Log` trait, suitable for use
//! in both embedded and desktop environments.
//!
//! Compared to existing approaches such as `ufmt`, `cortex-m-funnel` and `defmt`,
//! we pursue different values and requirements, namely:
//!
//! - **compatibility with the standard `core::fmt` traits and the standard `log` library API**.
//!   This means that, while libraries may "upgrade" their logging capabilities by using `delog`
//!   as drop-in replacement for their logging calls (see below), any existing library that already
//!   uses `log` is compatible. This, for our use cases, is a huge win, as opposed to using up "weirdness
//!   budget" and requiring custom tooling for something that is often trivial, throw-away, simple logging.
//! - it follows that one can easily drop a `trace!("{:?}", &suspicious_object)` call at any time for
//!   any object that has a (possibly automatically derived) `Debug` trait implementation – without
//!   passing around structures and keeping on top of lifetimes.
//! - deferred logging: This is a typical "shared memory" logger, calls to `info!` etc.
//!   are not directly sent to their final output, but instead are stored in a circular buffer
//!   that is "drained" by calling `flush` on the logger at a convenient moment, for instance
//!   in an idle loop.
//! - immediate mode logging: Sometimes one wants to bypass the deferred flushing of logs,
//!   this is possible using either the little-known `target` argument to `info!` and friends
//!   with "!" as parameter, or using the additional `immediate_info!` and friends macros.
//! - ability to set log levels *per library, at compile-time*. This can be easily retro-fitted
//!   on existing `log`-based libraries, by adding the requisite features in `Cargo.toml` and
//!   replacing `log` with `delog` (see `gate-tests` for examples of this).
//! - the outcome is that one can leave useful logging calls in the library code, only to activate
//!   them in targeted ways at build time, exactly as needed.
//! - helper macros to easily output binary byte arrays and slices in hexadecimal representations,
//!   which wrap the data in newtypes with custom `fmt::UpperHex` etc. implementations.
//!
//! **Non-goals**:
//!
//! - ultimate speed or code size: Our intention are "normal" logs, not the use of logging/tracing to
//!   for stream binary data to the host. While admittedly the `core::fmt`-ing facilities are not as
//!   efficient as one might hope, in our use cases we have sufficient flash and RAM to use these (and
//!   some hope that, someday, eventually, maybe, the formatting machinery will be revisited and
//!   improved at the root level, namely the language itself.)
//!
//! That said, we believe there is opportunity to extend `delog` in the `defmt` direction by
//! using, e.g., the `fmt::Binary` trait, newtypes and sentinel values to embed raw binary
//! representations of data in time-critical situations without formatting, deferring
//! the extraction and actual formatting to some host-side mechanism.
//!
//! ## Features
//! The `flushers` and `semihosting` features mostly exist to share code within the examples,
//! including the `example` feature. Without them, dependencies are quite minimal, and compilation fast.
//!
//! The `fallible` and `immediate` features (default on) activate the `try_*!` and `*_now!` macros, respectively.
//!
//! ## Warning
//! The current circular buffer implementation (v0.1.0) is definitely unsound on desktop.
//! For embedded use, atomics are required (so no Cortex-M0/M1, and no plans to support non-atomic
//! platforms, which are likely to also be too resource-constrained to support the bloat inherent
//! in `core::fmt`). While we think the implemented circular buffer algorithm works for the "nested interrupt"
//! setup of NVICs, it has not been tested much.
//! The hope is that the worst case scenario is some slightly messed up log outputs.
//!
//! ## Outlook
//! We plan to iterate towards a v0.2.0 soon, making use of a separate "flusher" for the
//! "immediate" logging path. For instance, when logging via serial-over-USB, one might want immediate
//! logs to pend a separate RTIC interrupt handler that blocks until the logs are pushed and read
//! (allowing one to debug the boot process of a firmware), or one might want to just write to RTT
//! (or even semihosting xD) for these, during development.
//!
